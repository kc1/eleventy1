<p><big>Hello, my name is Dan and I am the co-owner of a small real estate company. We are looking to purchase some properties in your area for investment purposes. </big></p>
<p><big>   We buy properties others no longer want (inherited, tired of paying taxes, live out of area) or need to sell (foreclosure, tax sale, etc.) </big></p>
<p><big>In the past, we have worked with a number of people who were very happy to have cash rather than the trouble of their unwanted property. </big></p>

<p><big> We work to make it easy for you to sell your land and eliminate your real estate nuisance. </big></p>
<p><big> In return for selling your property at a discount, we can offer a number of reasons to work with us: </big></p>
<p><big>

- pay 100% of your closing costs <br>
- help avoid realtor's fees<br>
- satisfy back taxes and fees<br>
- close in 30 days or less
  (if the title is clear) </big>
<p><big>By the way, none of this costs you a dime. </big></p>


<p><big>If you would like an immediate offer on your property, please fill out the form below.   </big></p>
<p><big> We will get back to you within 24 hours by email. </big></p>

<p><big>Whatever you decide, Best Wishes,</big></p>
</br>
<p><big>Dan,<br> </big></p>
