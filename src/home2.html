question: Would you like Cash for your property?
header1: We can help
---

<p><big> The Open Land Company is looking to purchase some properties in your area for investment purposes. </big></p>
<p><big> We buy properties others no longer want (inherited, tired of paying taxes, live out of area) or need to sell (foreclosure, tax sale, etc.) </big></p>

<h2> Why choose us? </h2> 

<p><big> Let's face it , if you are reading this you are probably holding several other postcards from companies like us. So what makes us different?</big></p>
<p><big> 1) TRUST : We recognize that you don't know who to trust with your property. WE DON'T CUT CORNERS. We work exclusively with THIRD PARTY LOCAL TITLE COMPANIES. 
  They are in business to facilitate the lawful transfer of property , following all relevant local customs and laws. You don't have to trust us, but you CAN trust them. </big></p>
<p><big> 2) FAST CASH : We have CASH ready to buy your property. Some companies need to market your property to see if there is interest. This can take months, and if they can't find a buyer, they will drop the deal , 
  leaving you holding the bag. If we make you an offer, you can be sure we have the cash to back it up! 
 Our plan is to close within 30 days. Picture yourself with CHECK IN HAND, IN 30 DAYS after signing a contract with us!</p></big>
<p><big>  </big>

  <p><big>By the way, none of this costs you a dime. </big></p>

<p><big>You will be working with me throughout the process. I'll be available to talk and answer questions. My goal is to help you get through the process easily, without any drama or funny business</big></p>

<p><big>Thanks for your time,</big></p>
</br>
<p><big>Dan,<br> The Open Land Company.</big></p>
