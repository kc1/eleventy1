<p><big> The Open Land Company is looking to purchase some properties in your area for investment purposes. </big></p>
<p><big> We buy properties others no longer want (inherited, tired of paying taxes, live out of area) or need to sell (foreclosure, tax sale, etc.) </big></p>

<p><big> We work to make it easy for you to sell your land and eliminate your real estate nuisance. </big></p>
<p><big> In return for selling your property at a discount, we can offer a number of reasons to work with us: </big></p>
<p><big>

- We pay CASH and close quickly ( in 30 days or less if the title is clear)
- We ALWAYS work with local 3rd party title companies
- We pay 100% of your closing costs , including realtor's fees<br>
- We can help you satisfy back taxes and fees<br>
 </big>

  <p><big>By the way, none of this costs you a dime. </big></p>

<p><big>You will be working with me throughout the process. I'll be available to talk and answer questions. My goal is to help you get through the process easily, without any drama or funny business</big></p>

<p><big>Thanks for your time,</big></p>
</br>
<p><big>Dan,<br> The Open Land Company.</big></p>
